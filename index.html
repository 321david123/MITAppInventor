            <h3>Interest in App Inventor</h3>
            <p> When I was in high school in Mexico, we used app inventor several times to create apps. As user I remember all the things we could do but also things that could be improved.
                App Inventor empowers users without a CS background to create functional apps and help them see how programming works. I'm interested in tools that make programming accessible and fun, especially in educational and low-resource environments like the ones I grew up in.</p>

        <section id="interest-programming" class="question-section">
            <h3>Interest in introductory programming</h3>
            <p>Through Sonríe Mexico and local school collaborations, I introduced students to the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. Also, when we had projects in my programming classes I helped 50+ students create their first CRUD working version and from there they improved themselves. My generation in high school was the one with the most projects oustide of class and I think the compound help from many people resulted into this.</p>

        <section id="proposed-project" class="question-section">
            <h3>Proposed summer project</h3>
            <p>I propose enhancing App Inventor’s accessibility features and adding an AI-powered helper for block building. The goal is to assist users with disabilities and beginners in designing logic faster, using suggestions, keyboard navigation, voice-to-blocks, and visual contrast tools. This will expand the tool’s reach, especially in education.</p>

            <h3>Experience with development tools</h3>
            <h4>Java</h4>
            <p>Studied Java formally and used it for desktop apps and algorithm practice. Contributed to open-source Java-based platforms in accessibility projects.</p>
            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            <p>Built several production-level apps in React and vanilla JS, including a real-time global chat app. Focused on performance, state management, and real-time interaction.</p>
            <h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
            <p>Expert in creating accessible and responsive layouts. Designed startup landing pages and interactive components using modern CSS and ARIA best practices.</p>

            <h3>Experience with teams, dev communities, and large codebases</h3>
            <p>Worked with distributed teams in RuedaTec and multiple hackathons. Navigated complex repo structures in real-world settings. Participated in Agile sprints and led documentation and version control in 10k+ line projects. Also very active in community forums and GitHub issue collaboration.</p>

            <h3>Application Challenges</h3>
            <h4>Challenge 1: Non-trivial App</h4>
            <p>Developed an offline emergency response app for rural areas using App Inventor, running fully on-device with offline maps and SOS triggers. Built and deployed via local MIT server. Links:</p>

            </ul>
            <h4>Challenge 2: Camera Component Redesign</h4>
            <p>
                The `useFront` property fails on newer Android due to deprecated APIs and shifting permission models post Android 10. My proposal introduces a new method `TakePicture(auto: boolean)` to allow background image capture if permissions allow, and a `preferredCamera: "front" | "back"` property. I would update `Camera.java`, `Form.java`, and integrate changes into the GWT interface. This would use CameraX for compatibility. I can provide the full proposal if needed.
